# Eaveswall

[Eaveswall](https://eaveswall.com) is a campus blog site built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). It was really fun building this blog with Gatsby, React and other underlying technoligies including development, deployment and production. If you've not tried Gatsby, I advise you do so quickly.

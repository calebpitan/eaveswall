### Guidelines to writing a featured article

Featured article request can get turned down if they aren't compliant. Every featured article request passes through review, and we try as much as posiible to correct erroneous phrases and clauses, provided they are mild enough. We also do our best with correcting lexical errors. But make sure articles are perfect or at least close to being perfect as it's a good quality to look out for in all writers.

#### Know your facts

If you'll be writing about something technical, it's is important you gather facts rather than assumptions or sentiments. Take time to study what you will be writing about, and make sure your article is not misleading in any manner. If you come out here with personal opinions and what you feel is right rather than what is conventionally true, then your article will end up misleading some &mdash; or probably, a lot of &mdash; people. This, most times, will take a toll on affected persons. In case you want to express your personal opinions contrary to what's conventional, it should be explicitly stated: "IMO (In My Opinion)".

#### An Article cannot be libelous or slanderous

An Article cannot contain contents that blackmail or says bad about someone in any form, written or recorded, without valid proof of what is claimed. We do not entertain libelous articles, so as to keep controversy far away and not have ourself caught amidst ongoing feud between two or more parties, rather, we strongly welcome articles with great value and importance that impacts readers positively.

#### Contents and sources must be legit ðŸ‘Œ

Wherever you pull your contents and resources from, make sure it's legit as we would not be held responsible for any copyright infringement on any copyrighted content or resource embedded in whatever you send to us to put up here. So if you mess with others' wit, thereby infringing a copyright or violating a license, you'll be held accountable under the law not us.

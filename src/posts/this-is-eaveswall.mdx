Hello to everyone out there, this is Eaveswall! We welcome you to the launch of this blog site, thanks for reaching out. We hope you keep coming to read our intriguing contents, gists, updates and as we usually say: "The eaves that drop; the wall that falls". Don't just let the eaves drop we'll pick it before it even lands, and don't let the wall fall, we'll peek in before it rises.

We do nothing here, but sit and watch eaves drop and walls fall, and tailor you with the best content, vibes, gist, discussions on all conceiveable topics&mdash;being crucial, the fun too. As creepy as that sounds, we don't eavesdrop and we don't gossip.

Our media is not only limited to this blog site (isn't it obvious already?, since "media" is plural), we have a [Twitter handle (@eaveswall)](https://twitter.com/eaveswall) too. You should follow us: as most of the interactions take place there. Amongst which is our [Instagram (@eaveswall_)](https://instagram.com/eaveswall). You see, we mean business and we got you all covered.

## Do you love writing, want to get featured?
You've been in the shadows for too long. Here's the opportunity for you to get out. If you enjoy writing articles, you can contact us and [drop your article on for review][admin]. We'll review them and edit them if necessary.

We've got two packages under our featured posts:

  * Featured articles (free)
  * Featured Persona (paid)

Featured articles are free, as we love to encourage brilliant minds to keep writing. So if you'd love to get your article featured, it's all free forever.

Featured persona is all about your own personality. You want to let people know who you are, have them find out about you and link up: This package isn't free, but it's almost free 'cause we only charge a token amount.
Here are steps to getting yourself featured:

  1. Write what you want people to know about you.
  2. Attach a minimum of one, and a maximum of three clear images of yourself.
  3. Add a medium for people to contact you.
  4. Publish from [our editor][admin-persona].
  5. You will be sent a link to the post that features you.
  6. Voila, you've just been featured.

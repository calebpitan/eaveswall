Hello to you all, freshers, welcome to the University of Ibadan, _the first and the best_. I know it's been a very long journey getting here, but you are here already, "there's nothing anyone can do about that". Don't matter what it has cost you; you are not a jambite anymore. I am happy for you, and everyone at Eaveswall is too. You are embarking on a 4 - 6 years journey on this campus, this is just your start, I sure hope you have plans. If not, it's time you came up with one, at least. It's good to have you join us. Once again, welcome on board.

## Was it even your choice?

That's a $64K question. Some are here now, but they didn't want to be here initially, and are probably unhappy they landed here. Well, when we were young, we never wanted to go to KG, but we went anyway here we are, adapted to all the rigour and bullying&mdash;even by our teachers then. So you'll soon get over it. The University of Ibadan is a good place to be; count yourself lucky to be here.

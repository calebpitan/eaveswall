There's no doubt that nothing comes easy as it may seem in life. People involve themselves in lots of professions to sustain a living. Things like entrepreneurship, skill acquisition, et cetera. Some even live off their innate skills. 

People face a lot of challenges peculiar to these professions. For example: entrepreneurs face problems with raising startup capital before establishment and struggle during the business to keep their establishment stable and on a firm ground while the skillful artisans may run into creativity scarcity, suboptimal imagination and lack of state-of-the-art tools, equipments and technologies.

The problem we all face, generally, is **time**&mdash;time is a luxury we can't spare or lend out, because even the portion of it we are provided with doesn't suffice. Everyone is on the make, but time is the limiting factor. The time to commit to and learn a new skill, attain mastery and expertise in its scope is what most of us don't have. This problem is common to students the most, in fact almost everyone, even adults, especially those with a family to cater for.

What if I told you that, given the current pandemic crisis, Corona&mdash;that has beyond-human-control, leaving us no choice, brought everything in the world to a halt&mdash;has given an advantage to those hoping to learn a new skill to help kick them beyond academics or their current status quo either just for acquisition sake in the name of "personal interest" or for entrepreneurial purpose, won't you take the chance? Why don't you learn while putting yourself at home, having all the time to yourself, making do with what you have&mdash;be it your mobile phone.

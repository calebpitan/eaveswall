Hello subscribers. How are you fairing? Corona virus is a big deal in the whole wide world. So big that even those who are not affected are affected. Yeah, it's that messed up. Football lovers can't watch their icon-footballer take the field any more. Not only footbal though, virtually all sports are locked down.

The team at Eaveswall cares about your well-being and safety. We hope you are safe and also want you to stay that way. Staying safe is the most important thing, since it's the only way to fight the pandemic.

## How you can stay safe

The "hows" to staying safe is for sure no new thing to you but to let it ring in your ear, let us do a brief reiteration

  * Wash your hands regularly with a hand sanitizer or an antiseptic bar soap.
  * It is impossible, but try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
  * Cough into your elbow is what they say; do well to heed.
  * Practice social distancing, at lest for now; keep at least a distance of 1-2 meters between people.
  * Report cases to the [Nigeria Center for Disease Control](https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng)
  * Wear your nose mask when going out (fuck me, I don't have and never had one ðŸ˜·).
  * Stay home when you are asked to.
  * Most importantly, pray to **God** to keep you safe.

Stay safe.

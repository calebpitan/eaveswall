It has become a habit for our politicians to fly overseas when they get sick, 'cause they are aware of the little or no empowerment they give our health sector here, and are scared of trusting their lives into the beautiful lifeboat they have failed to inflate and make buoyant in due time.

Now, with the pandemic, countries are locked-down and our "rich" politicians are locked-in. Nigeria's politicians are grounded and can fly to UK for medicals no more, at least till the pandemic passes. They should just hope to never get sick while COVID-19 lasts.

For these politicians, there exists no more the privilege to get flown overseas and pick appointment with foreign medical doctors when they get sick. So if they do get sick, they should pray they don't die in the hands of the doctors they have failed to encourage and invest in. If they do and the worst happens to them, I will consider it: motherland dripping what they had sown on them. If only they had invested in the health sector of the country in due time, they will be at rest and confident enough to trust their lives into the hands of their very own doctors.

They have failed the doctors of this country. I hope the doctors of this country don't fail them, better still, they shouldn't get sick, 'cause if they do, the hospital they might be taken to may not have an ECG (electro-cardiogram), much less a defibrillator ðŸ˜‚.

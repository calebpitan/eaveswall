          Eaveswall is a campus blog and not your "normal gossip sites". We just
          want to bring the fun to all, without restrictions, 'cause
          there is no fun in restrictions. We are not a{" "}
          <em>"See what Davido ate last night"</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;kinda blog or a{" "}
          <em>"You won't believe..."</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;kinda...those are just
          click baits you often times fall for while you end up not being
          amused. We are more like <Link>go find out for yourself</Link>.
          Eaveswall is a place to make fun, share opinions, in fact do whatever you want freely.

          The Eaveswall ecosystem includes realtime interactions on twitter, whatsapp and  instagram. Promotions, giveaways and contests are part of what makes the ecosystem we create a great one, too.
